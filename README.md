Project Version 1.0 08/30/2021

Description:
--------------
- Using the React framework, I built a minimal, clean and easy-to-use quiz game comprised of 10 challenging questions.
- Once the user finishes playing the quiz game, the application provides the user with how many questions they scored incorrectly out of 10 questions. The quiz game also does not indicate which questions the user got correct, so that the user can play the quiz game multiple times and still enjoy.
- Live demo: https://pathumd.github.io/quiz/

Tools used:
--------------
- React (JavaScript)
- HTML
- CSS
